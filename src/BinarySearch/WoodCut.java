/**
 * Lint Code 183 Â· Wood Cut: https://www.lintcode.com/problem/183/
 * Hard
 *
 * Description
 * Given n pieces of wood with length L[i] (integer array). Cut them into small pieces to guarantee you could have equal or more than k pieces with the same length. What is the longest length you can get from the n pieces of wood? Given L & k, return the maximum length of the small pieces.
 *
 * The unit of length is centimeter.The length of the woods are all positive integers,you couldn't cut wood into float length.If you couldn't get >= k pieces, return 0.
 *
 * Example
 * Example 1
 *
 * Input:
 * L = [232, 124, 456]
 * k = 7
 * Output: 114
 * Explanation: We can cut it into 7 pieces if any piece is 114cm long, however we can't cut it into 7 pieces if any piece is 115cm long.
 * Example 2
 *
 * Input:
 * L = [1, 2, 3]
 * k = 7
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: It is obvious we can't make it.
 * Challenge
 * O(n log Len), where Len is the longest length of the wood.
